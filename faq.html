        <h1 style="text-align:center;">F.A.Q</h1>

        <h2>Y U do this?</h2>
        <p>Cause me sucks at front-end development, and wanted to learn how to make nice webpages.</p>

        <h2>Y U not use bootstrap?</h2>
        <p>Cause bootstrap has so much shit, and on top of it, both run on top of jQuery. So it made perfect sense for me studying jQuery and CSS first - with little bits of jquery-ui.</p>

        <h2>Ur webpage is broken on browser "X"!</h2>
        <p>Cross-browser compatibility never was the objective of this project. Maybe later (I said: maybe!).</p>

        <h2>What tools are U using?</h2>
        <p>At first I tried using Notepad++ and Eclipse, but both sucked at jQuery code hinting and autocompletion. So I looked around in the Internets, and found this nice webdesign-focused IDE called Brackets, by Adobe.</p>
