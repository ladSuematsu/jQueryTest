        <p>
            <b>M.A.W.jQ</b> is a non-profitable project made by a nice-guy-programmer, messing around with the tools for developing web front-end
            applications. And of course, trying (hard) to make it look nice.

            You can use this as a source material for studying HTML, CSS, jQuery and JavaScript. The only thing I ask
    you, my friend, is to (PLEASE!) credit me if you are ever going to reproduce, or alter it. Don't credit yourself for other people's doings. Otherwise, you're a fucking a****le and deserves to die an horrible death - just kidding (nope).</p>

        <p>All the source is available at my gitHub account: https://github.com/ladSuematsu/jQueryTest</p>
